    <h3>Array Data Structure</h3>

    <h4>Implementation of Array</h4>

        <p>
            All arrays have a length property, which as shown
             above, can be very easily accessed with the syntax
             <span>Array.lenght</span>   <br>
              
              A more complex implementation of an array can 
              be seen below. Two types of array- one-dimensional array and
               a multi-dimensional array, or an array that contains other arrays. 
        
               Arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.
